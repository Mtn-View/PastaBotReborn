Hello this is my bot, I only worked on it for like three hours so it does all of three things basically. 
I don't remember the command to fetch the dependencies and it's almost 5am so I'm going to save that for later if I remember how to do that.
Also add your discord bot's token to "auth.json" to get it to work with your bot.
I also really don't know how to use git that well so hopefully this works well enough.

run bot.json with node or nodemon to start the bot.
config.json lets you set the prefix, might add more stuff to that later, idk.
index.json contains all the helper methods used in bot.json
